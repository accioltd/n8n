title: Approach
nist1: |
    NIST CSF addresses all aspects of managing cybersecurity by prescribing 108 practices across five functional domains – Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. In addition to the standard framework, C3Plan augmented practices with guidance for each level of maturity, improving the overall quality and confidence in assessment, prioritization, and recommendations.
    The Capability Maturity Model Institute (CMMI) maturity scale provides 5 levels, each progressively building upon the previous, and has been used as the measuring standard.
    To achieve high confidence and completeness, several teams participated in the assessment, based on their direct involvement in:
    •	Day-to-day operations/management security practices, and/or
    •	Security-related design and implementation of projects
